# Week 8 â€“ FNB App Academy

This week focused on advancing our **Python skills** by working with **core data structures** and building a complete **Shopping Cart App** using only Python.

## Topics Covered:
- Python data structures:
  - Lists (Part 1 & 2)
  - Tuples
  - Sets
  - Dictionaries (Part 1 & 2)
- Applying these structures in real-world projects
- Project-based learning with a terminal-based shopping cart system

## Project: Shopping Cart
In this project, we created a **command-line shopping cart app** that allows users to:
- View a list of available items
- Add and remove items from the cart
- View cart contents and total
- Exit the program with final cart summary

- ## Technologies Used:
- **Python 3**
- Lists, sets, tuples, dictionaries
- Control statements (`if`, `else`, `while`, `for`)
- Terminal-based user input and display

## Highlights:
- Built a fully functional Python application without any front-end code
- Learned to manage dynamic data using native Python structures
- Practiced core programming logic, user interaction, and loop-driven workflows
